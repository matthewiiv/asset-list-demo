# AssetListDemo

This is a demo app for a Frontend technical test

To run:

`npm install`

Start JSON server

`json-server --watch db.json`

## Development server

Open a new terminal window and run:

Run `ng serve -o` for a dev server. This will open a tab in your browser at http://localhost:4200/



## Improvements

Build generic form component that shows fields dynamically depending on asset type

Checkboxes to allow user to perform actions on multiple list items at once

Allow user ability to create new asset type / decide fields
